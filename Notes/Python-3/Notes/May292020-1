I am in  a weird place, in terms of learning Python. I am really interested in Python libraries, such as Pandas, matplotlib, NumPy, etc., but I am not sure what to do, or where to go. There are a lot of things that I can do, and Python is much simpler to me than something like C, so I can kind of figure a lot of things out through just trying stuff, but I don't really know what to try. I am going to try my hand at creating some command-line programs, as I love the terminal, and I have wanted to make some kind of terminal-based program for a while now. I also want to try working with some ML frameworks, specifically for chatbots and personal assistants. Wish me luck, me!
